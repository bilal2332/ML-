Machine Learning Assign 1
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict students' math scores using the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing steps such as checking for missing values, encoding categorical features using LabelEncoder, and standardizing numerical data with StandardScaler. Two regression models were developed: a basic linear regression model and a polynomial regression model with degree 2 features. Both models were trained and tested, and their performances were compared using standard evaluation metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score. Results showed that the polynomial regression model outperformed the linear regression model in predictive accuracy. Additionally, visualizations such as feature distributions, a correlation heatmap, and predicted vs. actual score plots were included to support the analysis. This repository contains the main Jupyter Notebook (ML_ASSIGN1.ipynb) and a written summary (ML_Assignment_Summary.docx) outlining the entire process and key findings.
